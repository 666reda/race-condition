# race-condition
Small python script to test and exploit web-based race condition vulnerabilities

1. Open `race-condition.py` with your python editor
2. Change the `host` variable to your target
3. Add your own cookies and POST body
5. Launch the script and let the threads ruin your target :smiling_imp:

I wrote this script in a hurry with my friend [Sphyn3x](https://github.com/sphYn3x), hope someone will come later and modify it so the HTTP requests will be sent on the same TCP connection.
