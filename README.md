# race-condition
Small python script to test and exploit web-based race condition vulnerabilities

1. Open `race-condition.py` with your python editor
2. Change the `host` variable to your target
3. Add your own cookies and some body
5. Lunch the script and let the threads ruin your target :smiling_imp:

I wrote this script in a hurry, hope someone will come later and modify it so the HTTP requests will be sent on the same TCP connection.



*PS : I love you Asmae*
